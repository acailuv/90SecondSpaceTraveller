# About the Game
You are a space traveller. You have an ambition to be the richest person in your galaxy. In order to do so, you have to trade commodities, grind your passive income and survive the harsh environment of the cold-hearted universe. You have to collect 100,000 Space Credits (Cr.) to become the richest person in the galaxy. Assisted by your trusty assistant (AI) Via, you venture forth facing the cold abyss and the anomaly of time and space to achieve the title you dreamt of.
## Challenges
- **[Lost Sector]**: The universe is full of mysterious events that even the most intelligent being could not comprehend. The **[Lost Sector]** is a kind of unstable dimensional gate that will swallow your ship if you delve too deep. Avoid this at all costs.
- **[Rogue Planets]**: These are planets that flung out of their solar system and roam through space, endlessly. Avoid these obstacle when you travel from city to city.
- **[Space and Time Anomaly]**: The infamous **[Space and Time Anomaly]** has been around for quite some time now. There are rumors that the environmental damage that was caused by the rich started this anomaly. The misusage of dimensional rift powers triggers this anomaly. But hey, no one really knows for sure.
